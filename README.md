Chess AI
========

A new attempt at a Chess AI in Rust.  This attempt will try to achieve the following goals:

- [ ] Using proper bitboards for move generation 
- [ ] Using some sort of Arena for the tree
- [ ] Minimax w/ alpha-beta pruning
- [ ] Iterative depth first search
- [ ] Adaptive search depth over the course of the game and how much time is remaining

Stretch Goals:

- [ ] Hooking up to Chess.com API to play against
- [ ] Setting up tournament server for other AI to play against/rank.
